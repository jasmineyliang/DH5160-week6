### Task 1: Create a Vector
**Question:**
Create a vector named `numbers` containing the numbers 1 to 10.

```r
# Your code here
```

### Task 2: Calculate Mean
**Question:**
Calculate the mean of the vector `numbers`.

```r
numbers <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
# Your code here
```

### Task 3: Create a Sequence
**Question:**
Create a sequence of numbers from 5 to 50, incremented by 5.

```r
# Your code here
```

### Task 4: Subset a Vector
**Question:**
Extract the 3rd, 4th, and 5th elements from the vector `numbers`.

```r
numbers <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
# Your code here
```

### Task 5: Create a Data Frame
**Question:**
Create a data frame with two columns: `name` (containing "Alice", "Bob", "Charlie") and `age` (containing 25, 30, 35).

```r
# Your code here
```

### Task 6: Access Data Frame Columns
**Question:**
Print the `age` column from the data frame you created.

```r
# Your code here
```

### Task 7: Create a Matrix
**Question:**
Create a 3x3 matrix with the numbers 1 to 9 filled by row.

```r
# Your code here
```

### Task 8: Plot Data
**Question:**
Plot the numbers in the `numbers` vector against their squares.

```r
numbers <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
# Your code here
```

### Task 9: Write a Function
**Question:**
Write a function named `square` that takes a number as input and returns its square.

```r
# Your code here
```

### Task 10: Apply a Function
**Question:**
Apply the `square` function to each element of the vector `numbers`.

```r
numbers <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
square <- function(x) {
  # Your code here
}
# Your code here
```
